He then proceeds to analyze it, 1st, into its successive phonemes; 2nd, into a series of phonemes representable by its successive individual letters, whether or not this series coincides with the 1st series. After repeating each of these series alternately a few times, he begins to permute the members of each series. After uttering various permutations of each series alternately several times, he utters phonemes from both series in random order, uttering them singly, combining them into syllables, repeating them &/or prolonging them ad libitum. He ends the event by pronouncing one of these phonemes very carefully. \\n\",\n    \"Social Project 1\": \"Find a way to end unemployment, or find a way for people to live without employment.
