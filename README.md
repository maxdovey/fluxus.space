things easily forgotten -
*numbers.txt in this directory is just a local one for developing
*production numbers directory is full root path /max/flux-fone/
*this text file is used by flux fone to send out messages

* update all json files on server with clean edited local versions
* create stop / remove function (e.g. look for senders number from numbers.txt file and remove that item from list)
* remove duplicates from numbers.txt using auto response/ twiml
